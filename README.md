## Features:
•	Rasterized 3D models using the bling phong model and simulated the specular, diffuse, and ambient lighting.  
•	Incorporated bump map and displacement map to achieve an uneven and rough surface appearance.  
•	Implemented an interpolating algorithm to calculate normal and texture color values within a triangle.  


## Notes:
I ran this code in the Linux system.  
It Is implemented for learning purposes.
